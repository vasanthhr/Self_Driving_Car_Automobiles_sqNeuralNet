## Self_Driving_Car_Automobiles_sqNeuralNet

#### Getting Started


```
I have placed my code/package(main core part) in github repository, and please find the below points to understand more on it.

The code shows the neural networks, which involves Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) and Last layer of Recurrent Neural Network(RNN). 

Here, the Convolutional Neural Networks process the input frames/images and send back to Recurrent Neural Network.

I gave code here and it’s a foundation to achieve self-driving car/automobiles or autonomous car/automobiles,
But I haven’t posted any of my code that has more hidden layers and multi LSTMs (complete Deep Learning and Self/Auto learning). I can support/guide you if you want work on this Self/Auto learning process.
